## [2.1.0] - 2025-07-10

### üöÄ Major Performance & Trading Bot Enhancements

This release transforms the library from an educational implementation into a production-ready graph system suitable for financial trading applications.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Priority Queue Implementation** (`src/PriorityQueue.ts`)
  - Min-heap based priority queue for optimal performance
  - Reduces Dijkstra's algorithm complexity from O(V¬≤E) to O(V log V + E)
  - Supports priority updates for dynamic algorithms

#### Financial Precision
- **FinancialNumber Class** (`src/FinancialNumber.ts`)
  - 8-decimal place precision using scaled integer arithmetic
  - Eliminates floating-point precision errors in financial calculations
  - Supports all standard arithmetic operations with precise decimal handling
  - Safe for monetary calculations and trading applications

#### Thread Safety
- **ThreadSafeGraphImpl** (`src/ThreadSafeGraphImpl.ts`)
  - Read-write lock implementation for concurrent access
  - Async methods for safe multi-threaded operations
  - Supports multiple trading strategies accessing the same graph simultaneously

#### Real-Time Market Data Support
- **RealTimeGraphImpl** (`src/RealTimeGraphImpl.ts`)
  - Batched market data updates with configurable batch sizes
  - Automatic stale data cleanup with configurable time windows
  - Edge metadata tracking (timestamps, max trade sizes, data sources)
  - Arbitrage opportunity detection using negative cycle algorithms
  - Trade size validation against liquidity constraints
  - Performance monitoring and statistics

### üîß Changed

#### Core Algorithm Improvements
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Complete rewrite using proper priority queue
